Parliment's Ready — Demo News Site

This is a small, fictional demo news website created for a user request. All content is fake and intended for demonstration and prototyping only.

Files:
- index.html — The homepage for "Parliment's Ready" with fake company info and reader reviews.
- blog.html — Controversial opinion piece about a fictional parliamentary debate on whether insects should be allowed as pets.
- style.css — Styling for the demo site.

How to run:
- Open `index.html` in a browser. For best results, serve the directory with a simple static server (e.g., `python -m http.server` in the folder on port 8000) and visit http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- The site uses fictional content. Do not publish it as real news.
- If you want images or extra pages, I can add them.
